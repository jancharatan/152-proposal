        <h1 class="fw-bold">Re-Implementation of He et al.</h1>

        <h3 class="fw-bold">Description</h3>
        For my class project, I propose doing a re-implementation of the paper
        "Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners" by He et al. A masked
        autoencoder removes a portion of some type of data and learns how to
        predict the removed content. GPT and BERT apply this method in natural
        language processing and this paper applies the technique in computer
        vision. The methodology of this paper involves taking in training images
        and masking out some percentage of segments. The visible segments are
        then encoded with information about what is contained and the position.
        From there, a decoder takes in these encoded images and predicts the
        gestalt of new masked out images. The paper also goes into more detail
        about training various models with slightly tweaked methods and
        comparing the MAE method to other ones. The first image shows the basic
        process for the masked autoencoder. The second image shows what the
        final model produces for various masked outputs next to the original
        image.

        <h3 class="fw-bold">Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Understand the methods outlined in this paper and create a list
                of steps needed for re-implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Train a Neural Network using the optimal parameters so that is
                able to plausibly reconstruct images that the model has not
                previously seen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stretch goal: train more neural networks to explore the
                tradeoffs between things like percentage masked and the output
                of the model.
            </li>
        </ul>
